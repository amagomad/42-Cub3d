need to add -> my_put_pixel , better handle of key press for key repeat (tab of all the press and release key) I can also add the doors, I need to improve the handling of the mouse (it rotate but strangely, no impact on the real vision of the player) and i need to start thinking on the texture, there handling and how to add them to the raycating(need the raycasting) and maybe start thinking on the animated sprite...
