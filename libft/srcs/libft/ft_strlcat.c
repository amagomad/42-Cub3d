/* DESCRIPTION
     The strlcpy() and strlcat() functions copy and concatenate strings with
     the same input parameters and output result as snprintf(3).  They are
     designed to be safer, more consistent, and less error prone
     replacements for the easily misused functions strncpy(3) and
     strncat(3).

     strlcpy() and strlcat() take the full size of the destination buffer
     and guarantee NUL-termination if there is room.  Note that room for the
     NUL should be included in dstsize.  Also note that strlcpy() and
     strlcat() only operate on true ''C'' strings. This means that for
     strlcpy() src must be NUL-terminated and for strlcat() both src and
     dst() must be NUL-terminated.

     strlcat() appends string src to the end of dst.  It will append at most
     dstsize - strlen(dst) - 1 characters.  It will then NUL-terminate,
     unless dstsize is 0 or the original dst string was longer than dstsize
     (in practice this should not happen as it means that either dstsize is
     incorrect or that dst is not a proper string).

     If the src and dst strings overlap, the behavior is undefined.

RETURN VALUES
     Besides quibbles over the return type (size_t versus int) and signal
     handler safety (snprintf(3) is not entirely safe on some systems), the
     following two are equivalent:

           n = strlcpy(dst, src, len);
           n = snprintf(dst, len, "%s", src);

     Like snprintf(3), the strlcpy() and strlcat() functions return the
     total length of the string they tried to create.  For strlcpy() that
     means the length of src.  For strlcat() that means the initial length
     of dst plus the length of src.
	  If the return value is >= dstsize, the output string has been
     truncated.  It is the caller's responsibility to handle this.
